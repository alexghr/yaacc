# Yet Another Auto Complete Component

This is a simple Next.js app exploring autocomplete inside `<textarea/>` elements. This app is deployed to [yaacc.alexghr.me](https://yaacc.alexghr.me/).

## Run locally

This repo uses `pnpm` instead of `npm` or `yarn`. Either follow [official installation guide](https://pnpm.io/installation) or use [corepack](https://nodejs.org/api/corepack.html) (preffered).

There's also a flake file with a development shell available. Just run `nix develop` to enter the shell (or use direnv).

To run the development server:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

And to run the tests:

```bash
pnpm test
```
